        <p style="color: #2f373e; font-family:Aiice;">A target audience was identified, labeled “Modern Traveler.”
          A proto-persona was then created based on the “Modern Traveler” audience with hypotheses on potential pain points they might endure during their travel planning process. Five users based on 20 to 40 years of age and travel frequency were identified to conduct a planned survey interviewed and recorded over Zoom. 
         
         Questions were framed to look into what excites the users and what their perfect travel experiences will look like. But also how they go about their travel planning, how long it takes, and what they dislike about the planning process. Key findings and observations were that there was a high level of stress with travel planning and that there was great difficulty traveling in a group. 
         
         Products in the market today that solve these hurdles, for example, are TripIt and TripAdvisor. TripIt provides up-to-date travel information and declutters itineraries but to access all the features, and it needs to be with a paid subscription. TripAdvisor has a wide network base with many reviews that informs and helps travelers with their travel planning. Additional products in the market that specialize in
          different areas are Hopper and Airbnb. Hopper offers up to 40% savings on flights through the analysis of billions of flight prices daily. Airbnb gives travelers the ability to rent homes instead of hotels, giving travelers the amenities of home

          <p style="color: #2f373e; font-family:Aiice;">In the past years, there has been a lot of focus on travel that has been shared through social media platforms. Modern travelers that follow these feeds want to travel more but are always looking for tips on how to do so. But with the vast amount of travel websites and platforms out today, it can get confusing. There is a need to fill this gap by providing reliable travel tips, simplifying travel planning processes, and recommendations that can serve as your own personal online travel guide. </p>
      <h4 style="color: #2f373e; font-family:Rubik;">Goals:</h4><br>
      <p style="color: #2f373e; font-family:Aiice;">To develop an app that makes travel planning and arrangements easy, and that serves as a personal travel guide before and during travel with the ability to have social media attributes. </p>
      <h4 style="color: #2f373e; font-family:Rubik;">Methodology:</h4><br>
      <p style="color: #2f373e; font-family:Aiice;"> To obtain qualitative data, we will conduct interviews with participants. Questions will be asked to the participants from one-on-one interviews from an interview script that was planned. An online survey would also be conducted to obtain quantitative data. From the qualitative and quantitative data, a user persona will be created and be used for the development of the app. </p>

Her goal is to visit Bora Bora in the French Polynesia Islands, publish a book about her travels and save money for a home. There are a few things that limit Sarah, and she does get overwhelmed at times, not knowing what to do, hates wasting money, and doesn't like to be late. </p>
